# Data structures and algorithms

A computer program is a collection of instructions to perform a specific task. For this, a computer program may need to store data, retrieve data, and perform computations on the data. Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.

You need o think of this as ways to organize and compute data for any software idea.

## What is a Data structure

A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data

## What is an algorithm 

An algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem

## Why use them 

We use them in software engineering as a basis to create and maintain good software practices, efficacy and readability.

## When to use them 

When you are building a medium to large software. But is is ideal to start the practice from the beginning to build a strong foundation.
## Where to use them

typically use them in a software that is written to compute data or perform actions.

## How to use them 

Use them in conjunction with one another to build software.
